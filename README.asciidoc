= BeesIO-Game
Welcome to this project which is the client part of the BeesIO game made on Unity. The final goal is to make a '.io' style, massively multiplayer game available through a web page. For now, multiplayer has not been implemented yet. So there is only the client part of the game working locally with robots simulating the player.
